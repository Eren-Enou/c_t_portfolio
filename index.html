                <h1>Why Coding?</h1>
                <strong><small>Computers have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. And for most of that time, they embodied a magic box that allowed one to emulate anything that can be thought of or delve deep into the archives of modern information. After learning how computers were structured I became curious about how they operated. Learning a programming language has been the most eye openning method of learning a new language. The language that a computer understands is the most universal language to research, and I am always excited to learn more about how to lead a computer.</p>

                </h1>
                <strong><small>After graduating in 2019 from CSUS, I began working for a food exporting company in their accounting department. While there, I learned more than college ever taught me and transferred my skills for my move to other financial accounting teams. I feel like I need change in my life while I have time, and am looking to move over to a primarily coding based field. I have the soft skills necessary to nagivate the business world.</small></strong>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <strong><small>I enjoy spending time on my own, reading a thrilling novel, writing anything that comes to mind, and learning about how AI is entering the creator spheres.</small></strong>
                <p>My current favorite chatbot is ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI, a company now valued at 29.0 billion dollars. What I love most about this chat bot is how it was trained. Machine learning has to be my favorite topic to learn about. How an inteligent agent can interact with its environment, take autonomous action, and use knowledge to learn.</p>
                <p>ChatGPT first went through supervised learning of a human playing both sides of the conversation, and then reinforcement step humans assigned value to responses the model created. Eventually using reward models fine tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization.</p>
                <p>Using ChatGPT as a friendly tool to assist in the never ending learning that is computer programming makes it a fun and interactive way to study.</p>
